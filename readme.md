# A fork of EmonLibCM to run on an ESP32 with one or more ADS115 analog input devices

The EmonLibCM library is maintained by @Robert.Wall and mirrored here for users of github.

See forum release: [EmonLibCM](https://community.openenergymonitor.org/t/emonlibcm-version-2-03/9241/1)

The following release notes are copied from the forum thread. The installation section is modified to reflect git command line installation.
